Introduction
------------

The test/run.js test runner is intended to work like the nose python test runner. That means:


Running Tests
-------------

This is how I'm invoking the test runner:
	MJSUNIT_PATH=~/projects/v8/test/mjsunit/mjsunit.js ENVJS_PATH=~/projects/envjs/ node test/run.js test

The the test runner uses mjsunit for its assertion and a hacked env.js to provide a browser-like environment. Past that, I invoke the test runner (test/run.js) with node and tell it where to look for tests (test).
