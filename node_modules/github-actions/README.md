Kickstart automation in one command.
Clone, update and share [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflows and best practices.

Comes with awesome packs for

[Go](https://github.com/mvdan/github-actions-golang),
[Terraform](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions),

## Basic usage

```bash
# install globally or locally
npm i -g github-actions
# npm i --save-dev github-actions

# run interactive manager
# in a GitHub repository root
ghactions

# or check how to run non-interactively
ghactions --help
```

## Automated automation?

Yes, why not! Even small projects nowadays have at least simple CI/CD to enforce best practices
or just to avoid boring release management. Thanks to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions),
it is super easy to kickstart an automation for a new project in minutes.

However, every project CI/CD has to be set up and updated separately,
even though they have a lot in common. So, instead of making our life easier,
CI/CD adds a new folder in a project to keep an eye on.

But imagine, what if we could...

- manage our GitHub Actions the same way we manage npm dependencies
- adapt CI/CD for different projects to our needs and still keep them in sync
- share the best CI/CD practices and collaborate to raise the bar even higher

And finally, what if we could add these best practices for a new project with a single command.

## Let's start today
- CI/CD for `Node.js` projects [installation guide](./nodejs_workflows/README.md)
- CI/CD for `Python` projects [installation guide](./python_workflows_py/README.md)
- CI/CD for `Rust` projects by [@actions-rs](https://github.com/actions-rs/example)
- CI/CD for `Go` projects by [@mvdan](https://github.com/mvdan/github-actions-golang)
- CI/CD for `Julia` projects by [@julia-actions](https://github.com/julia-actions/Example.jl)
- CI/CD for `Terraform` projects by [@dflook](https://github.com/dflook/terraform-github-actions)
- Or provide path to any GitHub repository to clone their workflows (run `ghactions`, then select `From GitHub URL`)
- Or even clone workflows from your local path (run `ghactions`, then select `From directory`)

## Advanced usage

### Simple, no-force update

- `jobs.*` are added fom remote
- `jobs.*.steps` that are `github-actions-managed` are updated from remote or removed if they do not exist remotely
- `jobs.*.steps` that are not `github-actions-managed` are kept untouched and preserve their position in workflow
- `jobs.*.steps` that exist only remotely are added to workflow to correct position, so to remove step, make in not managed and run empty `run` command to it, keep `id` the same.

### Force update

- Top comment in YAML file is replaced with remote
- `jobs.*` are deleted if they do not exist remotely
- `name` workflow name is replaced with remote
- `on` triggers are replaced with remote
- `jobs.*.env` is replaced with remote
- `jobs.*.strategy` is replaced with remote
- `jobs.*.runs-on` is replaced with remote
- `jobs.*.if` is replaced with remote
